This is basic Ansible yaml playbook in which we will be able to install and run nginx in target servers(whatever servers present in Inventory File) through the ansible server or host server.

NOTE: WE NEED TO INSTALL ANSIBLE, ENABLE PASSWORD-LESS AUTH FOR ANSIBLE TO DIRECTLY ACCESS THE TARGET SERVER AND EXECUTE THE TASKS.
